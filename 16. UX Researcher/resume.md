# UX Researcher

UX : the user experience is how a user interacts with and experiences a product, system or service.

User Journey :

- don't make maps too low level
- focus on process

Stakeholders circles, UX is not eorking alone :
- UX (designers, researchers, tech writers)
- Engineering (engineers, Q&A people, tech support)
- Business (upper management, product managers, marketing people, sales people)
_Stakeholder circles it's our research_ by Tomer Sharon

when to do researcher?

_idea generation > screening > idea evaluation > development > product evaluation_
- exploratory : to discovery opportunities for new initiative
- generative : to understand more between several and concepts
- evaluative : to discover area for improvement

Create goals : 
1. understand the background
  - ask your stakeholders what they want to learn
  - collect and study the available data first (google analytic data, heatmap, etc)

2. write down the goal
  - try to be concise and narrow down the goals to a spesific aspect of users behaviour/attitudes
