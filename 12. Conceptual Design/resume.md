# Conceptual Design
- keep it short and simple (kiss)
  - look at every word and sentence
  - consider using multi-sensory metaphors that tap more memory zones
  - test it on all kinds of other people

- make it easy to understand
  - create a consistent visual strategy
  - use more shapes than lines
  - use an animation to encourage an interaction
  - use precise vocabulary
  - break patterns when it is necessary

- make progress to user  visible
  - reduce over's uncertainty
  - offer a reason to wait and reduce user's perception of time

- make progress meaningful in order to reward user
- make succesful completion clearly visible
