- Skeumorphic defined as a technique used in UI design where objects, icons and buttons 
  mimic their real word counterparts
  Disanvantadges : most users had already learned how to use the interfaces, 
  difficult to scale a design, longer loading times and more bandwidth consumed

- Falt Design : minimalism at its core, the goal behind this language was to remove all purely
  decorative elements, make the design purely utilitarian
  Disanvantadges : difficult for new user, harder to predict how elements will behave

- Material Design : is more balanced interpretarion of flat 2.0 and attempts to marry the real
  and digital worlds. Material design is about using mostly flat elements with subtle 3D touches
  Disanvantadges : a bit tricky, similiar to flat design.
  
# Bouty 1 : 10 Principle of Good Design

- innovative : Practical implementationn of ideas that result in the introduction of new goods or
  services or improvement in offering goods or services.

- aesthetic
- makes a product understandable : there's nothing better designed than a product that
  explains itself, and so it's in a digital product.
- honest : shouldn't manipulate the way end users will interact with it to avoid generating unecessary frustration
- long lasting : don't strictly follow the trends of the moment.
- through down to te last detail
- environtmentally friendly 
- as little design as possible

# Bouty 2 : Color Theory

- Color Wheel : is usually built of primary, secondary and tertiary colors.
- Color Models : additive color model consider red, blue and  green (RGB),
  cyan magenta yellow and black (CMYK)
  - Color Harmony : is about the arrangemet of the colors in design in the most attractive 
    and effective way for users' perception. (split, triadic, tetradic, monochromatic, analogous,
    complementary)
